        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Rexy Que and my pronouns are they/them/theirs.
        I'm an artist, activist, software developer, and policy analyst living
        in Wichita, KS. Right now there isn't much on this page, but I plan
        on uploading some music and other artwork at some point. You can find me
        <a href="https://github.com/rexyque">on Github</a>, but there isn't much
        there to look at, lol.</p>
        <p>I have <a href="/resources">some resources for trans folx available</a>.
        Feel free to download them and share them with whomever you want.</p>
        <p><em>Thanks for visiting!</em></p>
